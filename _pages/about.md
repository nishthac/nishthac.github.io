*"If you have two theories that both explain the observed facts, then you should use the simplest until more evidence comes along"*  
-Occam's razor

This is my approach in life- "Keep it simple". Whenever I get a problem to solve, I always start with eliminating the most complicated solutions and work on the easiest approach. I am a Data Enthusiast,I break down complex problem into their simple solutions.
