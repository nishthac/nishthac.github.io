"If you have two theories that both explain the observed facts, then you should use the simplest until more evidence comes along"
"The simplest explanation for some phenomenon is more likely to be accurate than more complicated explanations."
-Occam's razor
This is my approach in life- "Keep it simple". Whenever I get a problem to solve, I always start with eliminating the most complicated solutions and work on the easiest approach. I am a Data Enthusiast, I break down complex data to it's simple solution.
